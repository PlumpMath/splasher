# Splasher

A small library built on [Seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw) /
Swing for splash screens.

## Usage

Add dependency to `project.clj`:

     [eigenhombre/splasher "0.0.2"]

Use `splash!`, something like the following (see `src/splasher/example.clj`):

     (ns try-splasher.core
       (:gen-class)
       (:require [splasher.core :refer [splash!]]))
     
     
     (defn -main []
       (splash! (clojure.java.io/resource "splash.png") :duration 2000)
       (System/exit 0))

Duration defaults to 2500 msec.

The splash image file should be located in the project resources
directory for your project (usually `resources/`), as shown.

The `System/exit` is required for your Seesaw / Swing app to exit.

In the Splasher project, `lein run` will run the included example.
