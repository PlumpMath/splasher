# Splasher

A small library built on [Seesaw](https://github.com/daveray/seesaw) /
Swing for splash screens.

## Usage

1. Add dependency to `project.clj`:

     [eigenhombre/splasher "0.1.0"]

1. Use `splash!`, something like the following (see `src/splasher/example.clj`):

     (ns try-splasher.core
       (:gen-class)
       (:require [splasher.core :refer [splash!]]))
     
     
     (defn -main []
       (splash! :duration 2000 :filename "splash.jpg")
       (System/exit 0))

Filename defaults to `splash.png`; duration defaults to 2500 msec.

The splash file image must be located in the project resources
directory for your project (usually, `resources`).

The `System/exit` is required for your Seesaw / Swing app to exit.

`lein run` will run the included example.
